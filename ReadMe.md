## My Portfolio

Welcome to my protfolio Read.Me page.

## Discription

This is my portfolio. I have been learning Full Stack Flex development through the University of Denvers Coding Bootcamp. In my protfolio you will see some of the coding languages I have leardned. This is an on going piece of work for me, because i will continue to learn new thisng through my coding programe. I have started chaning some things on my page from my original portfolio. The changes I have made are adding Bootstrape and Jquary to make my page more dynamic. 

## Installation

No Installation is required for this site.

## Usage

This page is built with a navigationbar to send you to my personal information. There is a Bio, Projects and Links section on my page. Also there is a contact area at the footer, that is set up to send a users information to localstorage. I would like to get this function to send to my email, but I am working on that. 

## Future Development

I would like to continue to add more dynamic elements from Bootstarp, and add some more effects using Javascript. I am looking forward to learning React that way I can really dive in and rebuild this page.
